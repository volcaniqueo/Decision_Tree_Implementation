# Decision_Tree_Implementation
This project was my 4th Homework for the course CMPE 480 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) at Bogazici University.

## About the Project
This project is a implementation for the classical decision tree learning algorithm using entropy as a splitting method. Please refer to the ozturk-volkan.pdf file for all information about the project (dataset, implementation scheme, plots, code, tree visualization etc.).
